/*
	Dialog strings can take parameters. A parameter is denoted by {n} where n defines the parameter index.
	Example string "You found a {0}!". This takes 1 parameter and inserts it before the exclamation mark. This is how the string "You found a Battle-Axe!" is created.

	All events and branches are executed from the scope of the instance that originally spawned the dialog.
	If the instance no longer exists then it is executed from the scope of obj_dialog.
	
	Macro expansion for instance variables is also supported, e.g. ${current_hp} will be replaced by the value of the "current_hp" variable on the calling instance if it exists, otherwise not.
